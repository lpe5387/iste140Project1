			<h2>Films that Resonate with Philly</h2>
			<h3>Rocky</h3>

			<p>Local viewers could take pride in seeing their city on screen, while audiences elsewhere could survey Philadelphia as they watched Rocky run past the Navy Yard, along the Schuylkill River, through the Italian Market, and down the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.  Other sites that appeared throughout the films, including Laurel Hill Cemetery, Rittenhouse Square, and Broad Street near City Hall, marked the setting as Philadelphia. Even the unglamorous row houses and shops in Rocky’s urban neighborhoods of Kensington and, later, South Philadelphia, represented the residential city. As the cityscape changed over the course of three decades of Rocky films, the movies documented that transformation.</p>
			<p>In addition to their role as a backdrop to the film, some sites, like the steps in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, actively contributed to Rocky’s story.</p>
			<p>The climax of Rocky occurred during a training montage when Rocky triumphantly bolted up the seventy-two steps that lead from the Benjamin Franklin Parkway to the neoclassical façade of the Museum of Art. Rocky’s physical ascent demonstrated how his self-esteem had grown throughout the film. When he arrived at the top, he gazed out at the Philadelphia skyline; on his way to becoming a nationally recognized boxing star, Rocky appeared to hold the entire city in his vision.</p>
			<p>The scene’s symbolism depended, too, on the museum’s cultural significance. Rocky’s journey from working-class Kensington to a recognizable bastion of high culture foreshadowed the wealth and cultural clout that the boxer earned as his career progressed.</p>

			<h3>Unbreakable</h3>

			<p>Unbreakable is a cult classic film known for its complex narrative and unexpected twists. What most people don’t realize is that the majority of the movie was filmed in Philadelphia, a city Shyamalan is notorious for setting his films in.</p>
			<p>In the movie, the main character David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is seen all over the great city of philadelphia. Dunn works – without ever having taken a day’s sick leave – at the stadium of the University of Pennsylvania, Franklin Field, 235 South 33rd Street, at Spruce Street.</p>
			<p>He attended a memorial service for the victims of the crash at Immaculate Conception Church, 1020 East Price Street at Ardleigh Street, Germantown, northern Philadelphia. It’s outside the church that Price leaves a mysterious message on his windscreen.</p>
			<p>Sets were built at the Philadelphia Civic Center, Convention Avenue at 34th Street, which, since 1995 has been used as a soundstage facility. Shyamalan’s “The Sixth Sense” was also filmed here, as did Beloved, but there are plenty of real Philadelphia locations, though not always what they seem.</p>
			<p>And, unlike David Dunn and Audrey (Robin Wright Penn), you won’t be able to enjoy a romantic cocktail at the rather enticing restaurant with the giant mural. It’s not a bar at all, but the lobby of the Curtis Center, 601-645 Walnut Street at Sixth Street (HQ of Curtis Publishing), northeast corner of Washington Square.</p>
			<p>Its huge, gleaming 1916 ‘mural’ is The Dream Garden, a Tiffany glass mosaic, based on a Maxfield Parrish painting. In 1998, it narrowly avoided being shipped off to grace a Las Vegas casino, when it was purchased by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. You can take a peek – the lobby is open to the public.</p>
			<p>And don’t plan to catch a train from the cavernous ‘railway station’ in which Dunn explores his colour-coded supersenses. It’s another Philadelphia lobby, that of the Packard Building, 111 South 15th Street at Chestnut Street. Built as a showroom and assembly plant for Packard cars, it became a publishing plant for the Philadelphia Record, before lying abandoned. It’s since been redeveloped as luxury apartments.</p>
			<p>Lastly, Dunn meets his son at the quaintly-named Pretzel Park, 4300 Silverwood Street, Manayunk, just west of city centre Philadelphia, on the banks of the Schuylkill River.</p>
